# Blank Elm Native Template

Additional information in [Elm Native](https://github.com/hariroshan/elm-native-library) repo.

- To add fonts, drop them inside `app/fonts`
- To add assets such as images, videos, etc, copy them to `app/assets`

These are copied automatically by NativeScript.

- Platform specific resources go into `App_Resources/`: [NativeScript Docs](https://docs.nativescript.org/project-structure/app-resources)
